# Two-stream-View-Invariance-SSL-on-Assembly101
We propose a pretraining method that uses two-streams of SSL to learn View-Invariance representation on Assembly101. Note that this method requires synchronized videos, and is concurrent with more advanced work Viewpoint Rosetta Stone(CVPR 2025) which uses unsynchronized videos. So do take a look at their work if you want to work on this.
